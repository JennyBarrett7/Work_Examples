unique_items is a database I created using several websites that allow you to create fake data.  I used it to create four tables: 
1) customers 
2) products 
3) orders 
4) order_items
and one view:
amount_per_order
Using this database I created different queries to isolate data I felt a store might be interested in obtaining.
