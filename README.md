# Work_Examples
Code created for potential employers to review.
This repository includes examples of MySQL exercises I completed.  
Instagram is from the last set of exercises in the Udemy course I took.  It includes the database used, the exercises assigned and my solutions as well as Colt Steele's solutions. 

employees_sample_database1 is from a web site for MySQL developers and designed to give developers more practice with their MySQL skills: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/employee/en/ .  There are no exercises provided with this site.  It is a database that allows developers to practice their coding skills.  I created my own queries.

unique_items is a database I created using several websites that allow you to create fake data.  I used it to create four tables: 
1) customers 
2) products 
3) orders 
4) order_items
and one view:
amount_per_order
Using these I created different queries to isolate data I felt a store might be interested in obtaining.
