1. Create folder to hold database. I called mine "employees_sample_database
2. cd to that folder.
3. In terminal, type git clone and then add the url address of the repository you want to clone. In this case it was: https://github.com/datacharmer/test_db
4. Then cd to the test_db using command: cd ./test_db
5. Run command in test_db: mysql < employees.sql
6. After that finishes running, run command in test_db: mysql -t < test_employees_md5.sql

I ran several queries using the db. At times I ran different queries and achieved identical results.
